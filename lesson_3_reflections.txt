When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

  When you want to share or work collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you pulled automatically, it could cause errors and conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is when you copy a repository on Github from one user to your Github repository.  A clone is when you make a copy of a repository.  A branch is a separate instance of a single repository.
